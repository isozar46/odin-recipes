    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup semolina flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons semolina flour</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons sesame seeds, divided</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 egg, separated</li>
      <li>1 cup lukewarm milk</li>
      <li>2 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons semolina, 2 tablespoons sesame seeds,
        sugar, yeast, and salt together in a large bowl. Whisk in oil, egg, and
        egg white. Stir in warm milk slowly until a liquid dough forms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the bowl with a plate or plastic wrap; let stand at room
        temperature until frothy, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in 2 3/4 cups flour with a wooden spoon until a sticky dough forms.
        Cover again and allow to rest for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a baking mat.</li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle 1 tablespoon flour over the dough and your hands. Mix dough,
        adding flour as needed, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it pulls away from
        the sides of the bowl. Shape into a round loaf and place on the prepared
        baking sheet. Cover loosely with a towel and let rise for 1 hour in a
        warm place until loaf doubles in volume.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Beat egg yolk and water in a bowl with a fork; brush over the entire
        surface of the loaf. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon sesame seeds on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until loaf is golden brown, about 20 to 25
        minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
